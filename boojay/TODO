ROADMAP
=======


******** Acknowledgement Release **************

* bean properties
** 'get(arg)' is the indexer (default member)
* monolipse wizard: new boojay project
* code completion for java library types
* monolipse: windows version should not require anything other than update site
* ensure pattern matching works with bean properties
* refactor all primitive dependent information into a PrimitiveInfo() tuple with things like
	* array store opcode
	* array load opcode
	* type descriptor
* move boojay to separate google project (http://code.google.com/p/boojay/)
* update monolipse site


********* Resolution Release ***************

** resident test runner
** internal macros work again
** support for referencing jar files and class file directories
* external callables
** automatically insert default parameterless ctor
* monolipse integration
** "Run As JUnit Tests"
* events


********** Pursuance Release ***************

* monolipse integration
** wizard: new boojay source folder
** resident incremental compiler
*** builder just sends delta information to the compiler
	which maintains the dependency tree and it's able to recompile
	required files on demand
	** deferred namespace implementation on top of a directory or jar file
** meta-programming by invoking the boojay compiler on temporary files generated from code literals
* ant tasks
* GetHashCode
* duck typing


*********** Psalm Release ****************
