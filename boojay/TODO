==================================

* debugging experience

* move boojay to separate google project (http://code.google.com/p/boojay/)

** resident test runner

* monolipse integration

*** builder just sends delta information to the compiler
	which maintains the dependency tree and it's able to recompile
	required files on demand
	** deferred namespace implementation on top of a directory or jar file
** meta-programming by invoking the boojay compiler on temporary files generated from code literals

* ant tasks

* refactor all primitive dependent information into a PrimitiveInfo() tuple with things like
